VISH ASSIGNMENT 
 I can juggle between coding and circuits—because why choose one when you can master both? 😎
 Debugging errors and fixing hardware issues are my version of solving mysteries! 🔍
 My creativity shines in both software logic and hardware designs—innovation is my playground! 💡
I believe coffee (or maybe snacks) is the ultimate fuel for late-night tech experiments! ☕🍪
 I love exploring new technologies and pushing my limits to build something cool! 🚀
 Whether it's writing code or wiring circuits, I enjoy making ideas come to life! 🔥
