Hi, I'm Vishaali R, a BTech student at Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College.
I have a keen interest in both software and hardware development thus I choose Computer and Communication Engineering.
I enjoy exploring new technologies, coding solutions, and working on innovative projects that integrate both domains.
I'm passionate about learning and building systems that bridge the gap between software and hardware.
